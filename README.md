# UI components

From now on we have to use the Conventional Commits specification for our commit messages.

For example, if our package is now at version 1.0.0, a commit message with this format:

```fix(homepage): fixed image gallery``` will bump the version to 1.0.1

```feat(logging): added logs for failed signups``` will bump the version to 1.1.0
